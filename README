JavaScript OAuth 1.0 Testing Tool

A very simple single-screen OAuth 1.0 tesing tool written in JavaSscript.
Based on the JS library OAuthSimple: https://github.com/jrconlin/oauthsimple/
and the NetFlix OAuth Test Page: http://developer.netflix.com/resources/OAuthTest
This script also uses jQuery 1.4.1 which we is also bundled in this repo.

With just your API Key, Shared Secret, Path (URL to API call) you should be
able to Generate a Signed Call (signature of your API call, keys, and nonce
value, and epoch time). Once that signed call is made, you can Execute Live Call.
If everything checks out, the API response will display in an IFRAME on the
right side of the browser window.
